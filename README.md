# üåç COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project provides visual analysis of global COVID-19 data, focusing on case trends, death rates, and vaccination progress across selected countries. It uses data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases) to draw insights through interactive and static visualizations.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 globally.
- Compare total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates between countries.
- Visualize trends using line plots, bar charts, and choropleth maps.
- Draw actionable insights from descriptive and visual data analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly.express
- geopandas *(optional)*

 ## üìä Key Insights
- The United States reported the highest total cases among the analyzed countries.
- India showed a rapid vaccination rollout in mid-2021.
- Kenya's total cases and deaths remained comparatively low but with slower vaccine uptake.
- A positive correlation exists between testing rates and lower death rates in some countries.

  ---

  ## üí° Reflections
- Data quality varies across countries and time periods; missing values required careful handling.
- Interactive choropleth maps were effective in showing geographic case disparities.
- Real-time data visualizations can guide public awareness and policy decisions.
